# Neural Network Clustering Project

This project implements a neural network from scratch in Python to classify clustered data points into three distinct classes. Using ReLU and Softmax activations, the model learns to identify patterns in the data and accurately predict class labels based on input features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase a simple yet effective neural network built from the ground up. It includes forward and backward propagation, along with a decision boundary visualization to understand how the model separates the data into different classes.

### Key Features
- **Manual Neural Network Construction**: The neural network is built entirely using NumPy, without relying on machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Classification of Clustered Data**: A sample dataset of clustered points is used for classification.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: The project includes a visualization function to display how the neural network classifies data points across the input space.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
